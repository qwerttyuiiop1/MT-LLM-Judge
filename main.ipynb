No action required.\n","- **Minor** â Small problem that does not materially affect meaning or usability (e.g., awkward phrasing, minor grammatical slip, minor punctuation error). Fix recommended but not urgent.\n","- **Major** â Significant problem that seriously affects understandability, fidelity, or usability. This includes errors that change meaning, omit essential info, or are highly inappropriate for the audience.\n","\n","---\n","## Evaluation criteria\n","\n","### 1) Term Accuracy & Consistency\n","**Definition:** The correctness or accuracy of translations of terms (root words).\n","\n","**Error Types:**\n","- **Inconsistent term use:** â inconsistent translations of the same term within the segment or document.\n","- **Incorrect terms:** Incorrect translations for words.\n","  _Break time_: **nasirang oras** (Major), **pahinga** (Minor, related meanings and may not significantly alter semantics, depending on context).\n","- **Technical / clinical / legal / jargon errors:** Poor handling of domain terms.\n","  _Glucose level_: **lebel ng asukal** (Major, alters meaning), **lebel ng glucose** (Minor, Glucose level may be preferred in medical contexts for clarity).\n","- **Names, numbers, and factual errors:** Misspelled place names or wrong proper nouns should be marked Major.\n","  _100_: **isang daan** (Correct, spelling variation), **isang libo** (Major)\n","  _Juan_: **John** (Major)\n","- **Spelling:** typographical or orthographic errors.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 2) Meaning Fidelity\n","**Definition:** Faithfulness to the source message â no distortion, omission, or addition.\n","\n","**Error Types:**\n","- **Mistranslation:** incorrect meaning conveyed.\n","- **Overtranslation / Addition:** extra information not in source.\n","- **Undertranslation / Omission:** missing information.\n","- **Loss of idiom, metaphor, tone or emotional weight:** euphemisms or humor that become flat â mark Minor or Major depending on whether meaning or tone is lost.\n","\n","**Examples:**\n","- Source: \"The medication is for temporary use.\" â **Major:** Permanenteng gamit ang gamot.\n","- Source: \"Please sign here for a bit.\" â  \"Pakilagda dito ng saglit\" (Correct, for a bit is captured by saglit).\n","\n","**Filipino-specific explanations & examples:**\n","- **Mistranslation of nuance / semantic flips:** In Filipino, verb focus (actor vs object) can change who performs an action. If translation flips focus and changes responsibility or intent, mark Major.\n","   Source: \"We asked for help.\" â **Major:** \"Hiningian kami ng tulong\". (implies we are the ones who were asked, not the ones who asked)\n","- **Tense/aspect/focus errors:** Incorrect tense/voice (e.g., translating general truths as past events). Filipino is a morphologically complex language. Classify as Major if the error significantly alters semantics.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 3) Grammar & Structure\n","**Definition:** Basic linguistic correctness and sentence formation.\n","\n","**Error Types:**\n","- **Grammar:** wrong conjugation, incorrect syntax.\n","- **Punctuation:** missing/extra commas, incorrect use of quotation marks, spacing, incorrect capitalization.\n","- **Wrong affixation:** **magisip** (Minor) vs **mag-isip**/**mag isip** (Correct)\n","- **Missing or incorrect linkers:** Dropped or wrong \"na\", \"ng\", \"nang\" â mark Minor when purely grammatical, Major if meaning changes.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 4) Style, Fluency, Naturalness\n","**Definition:** Is it culturally appropriate for Filipino readers?\n","\n","**Error Types:**\n","- **Unnatural word order and grammatical constructions:** Overuse of _ay_ inversion or awkward inversions that sound non-native â usually Minor.\n","  A 4.8 magnitude earthquake hit yesterday â **Major:** Ang lindol na may lakas na 4.8 ay tumama kahapon. (ay inversion with unnatural word order, should be \"Tumama ang magnitude 4.8 na lindol kahapon.\")\n","- **Unnatural wording / awkward phrasing:** phrasing that sounds non-native or overly formal â usually Minor.\n","  I know what I know. â **Major:** Ang alam ko lang ay ang nalalaman ko. (unnatural ay inversion, unnatural wording of \"ang nalalaman ko\" for \"what I know\")\n","- **Tone mismatch:** Translations that are unnaturally stiff or too slangy compared to the source text, usually Minor for small tone slips.\n","- **Improper code-switching and inconsistent register:** Inappropriate mixing of English and Filipino that breaks tone, Minor.\n","- **Style / flow / readability issues:** Awkward phrasing or repetition â typically Minor, escalate to Major if it blocks comprehension.\n","- **Overly literal / word-for-word translation:** Mechanical renderings that ignore idiom (e.g., literal metaphors) â mark Minor or Major depending on whether meaning or tone is lost.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 5) Cultural Biases\n","**Definition:** Use of culture-specific references, offensiveness, or language that wonât be understood by target audience.\n","\n","**Error Types:**\n","- **Culture-specific reference:** literal carryover of source culture references that confuse readers.\n","- **Offensive:** translations that create unintended insult or culturally insensitive phrasing.\n","- **Localization & cultural insensitivity:** Poor choices for culturally loaded terms (incorrectly as a translation for Creator in a secular context), mistranslated place names or history facts â Major when sensitive.\n","- **Audience appropriateness:** Culture-specific references that the intended Filipino audience won't understand should be adapted or explained; rate Minor or Major based on impact.\n","- **Age / gender, Cultural (preferring Western values over Filipino norms):** Biases are present in the translation that are not originally in the source text.\n","  The nurse went outside. â **Major:** Lumabas ang babaeng nars.

If the issue could cause user harm, legal problems, or serious misinterpretation, mark Major.\n","- If the translation intentionally adapts content for target-culture relevance (and this behavior is allowed by brief), mark **Correct** and note the adaptation; do not penalize for acceptable localization.\n","- Provide a short comment for every rating explaining what is right/wrong and provide a corrected alternative (one sentence or a span suggestion).\n","- After evaluating all criteria, provide an overall analysis of the translation and a rating from 1 to 5:\n","  - **1**: Incomprehensible translation, major issues in most criteria.\n","  - **2**: Poor but somewhat understandable, major issues in some criteria.\n","  - **3**: Poor but understandable, minor issues in some criteria.\n","  - **4**: Good translation, minor issues in one or two criteria.\n","  - **5**: Acceptably correct translation, with no issues in any criteria.\n","\n","---\n","\n","# Output format\n","The output should be a JSON object that conforms to the `TranslationEvaluation` model.
